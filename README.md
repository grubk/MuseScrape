1. Run the file
2. Enter prompted information into the terminal (browser, url in format: `https://musescore.com/user/{numbers}/scores/{numbers}`)

### ‚ÄºÔ∏èImportant Information
- This does not work if the sheet is not fully displayable on MuseScore (For exapmle, this happens when the author is MuseScore themselves: "Made By Muse")
- Inside main.py, there are some lines of code that you can un-comment to enable certain functions:
  - View the browser the scraper opens behind the hood
  - Print a list of the svgs that were scraped

### ‚ÑπÔ∏èHow Does It Work?

Using standard BeautifulSoup4 web scraping did not initially work for the MuseScore site, since sheet music was contained in a scrollable div that only displays the active page of sheet music in the page's html file.  
I had to use selenium to open an instance of a browser and then scroll within this div, extracting each page of sheet music as the script scrolls down.
  
The pages of sheet music are stored in svg format on MuseScore's end. I had to scale them to letter size, so they would fit in a printable pdf.
The svgs are sorted by the script, and then converted and given a new page on a .pdf file which is then downloaded onto the user's machine in the outputs folder.
